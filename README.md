# BandApp (working title)

## Description
This is a sample vue.js application. The goal is to make a frontend, with that you can manage bands, members and dates 
(like rehearsals and gigs).
This project is still work in progress. 

For keeping things simple, I will start with no api and no persistence layer and save all data in local storage.  

Technologies used in this project are: Vue.js, VueCli, VueRouter, VueMaterial, SCSS.
